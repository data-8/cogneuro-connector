    "Last lecture we learned about numpy N-D arrays. These are containers that hold the same type of data (float, int, boolean, etc.), are \"rectangular\" in shape and can have any number of dimensions. They are the basis of fMRI data storage and analysis. It is useful to think of any data stored in an array as lying along two different criteria, because these criteria constrain the types of operations and statistics we will perform on them. They can be formulated as questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do all the data points in the array represent the same kind of measurement?\n",
    "\n",
    " - For example, fMRI data does represent the same kind of measurement, because it is quantifying the BOLD signal across brain location and time.\n",
    " - The `Tables` used in the data8 class may represent different kinds of measurements per column (e.g. age, weight, height), even though their data type may be the same (e.g. `float`) making them representable as a numpy array.\n",
    " -  As we will see later in the class, when we analyze fMRI data we are interested in how much a given voxel responds to the types of stimuli or tasks in our experiment. These responses are quantified, and are called `weights`. Since they are measuring the response of a voxel to different types of stimuli or task, they are not similar measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. If the data points do represent the same kind of measurement: Are the measurements intrinsically ordered?\n",
    "\n",
    " - For example, 1D arrays representing BOLD fMRI time series have temporal ordering: Each entry represents the BOLD signal as time increases.\n",
    " - The rows of a data science table represent different samples that do not necessarily have any intrinsic ordering. This means that you can shuffle the rows without changing the meaning of the data. However, this does not mean that they do not need unique labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to the questions reveal that arrays can represent 3 diffferent meta-types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dissimilar measurements**: Answer no to question #1\n",
    "2. **Similar ordered measurements**: Answer yes to question #1 and question #2.\n",

It is often useful to get subsets of the data for different visualization and analyses we want to do. Although there are no hard-set rules about what the data stored in a specifically shaped array represents, there are guidelines that are very useful when working with fMRI data. The type of manipulation, visualization or analysis done on a specific array depends entirely on what it represents, and these guidelines help you to infer what the data represents just from knowing the shape.\n",

    "* **Axial, Saggital or Coronal Slice** - *[2D]*: One slice through a single 3D volume representing the BOLD data at a single time point for part of the brain. Plotted as standard 2-D images.\n",
    "* **Volume or TR** - *[3D]*: Represents the entire brain, contains all the BOLD data collected for a single time point. Plotted using multiple 2D images or flatmaps or 3D interactive plots.\n",
    "* **Scan or Run** - *[4D]*: All the 3D volumes collected during a run. Also, all of the voxel timeseries since a voxel timeseries is as long as a run. These are not plotted. They are read in from disk and subsetted for visualization, or just analyzed directly."
