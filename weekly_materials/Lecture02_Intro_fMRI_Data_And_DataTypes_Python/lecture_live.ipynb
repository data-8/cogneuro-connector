This is a common aspect of all programming languages that deal with images or numbers. Different formats for numbers use different amounts of memory. For data types that allow decimals (e.g. `numpy`'s `float32` and `float64`), the more decimal places that are stored for each number in an array, the more memory the array takes up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, converting to a less precise format (`np.float32`) can save memory, if precision is not critically important."

    "When data files are many gigabytes large, too large for computer memory, then we have to come up with ways of not having all of it in computer memory at once. This is such a common problem, that modern operating systems have come up with ways of doing this as best as possible without the computer programs even knowing that not all of the data they are working with is in live memory. One of the mechanisms by which this can happen is **memory mapped arrays**: These are arrays that are stored on the hard drive, but the relevant chunks of it are loaded into memory.\n",
