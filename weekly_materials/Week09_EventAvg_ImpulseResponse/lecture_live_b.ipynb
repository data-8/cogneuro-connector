    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lab, we computed event-related averages for responses to different categories of objects. We saw that response in fMRI emerge slowly (2-3 TRs or 4-6 seconds) after the onset of a stimulus. Fundamentally, the most common thing that we want to know in fMRI experiments is how some event is related to brain responses. The event related averages show us that some areas of the brain respond more to some stimuli than others, but we would like a more firm statistical basis before we draw any conclusions from our data. This week, we will introduce how to model the delay in that data.\n",

    "fMRI responses emerge slowly after the onset of a stimulus (or any other event). This means that, if we want to make an accurate mathematical model of how the brain responds, we have to somehow incorporate this delay into our model. \n",

An impulse response function describes the way a signal emerges (for any system) after an event.
