    "## Goals for today\n",

    "In neuroscience, the most common form of data is called a *timeseries*. This essentially means that we have a sensor that collects information about some signal in the brain as it changes across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A timeseries can be anything from stock market fluctuations, to the changes in score during a basketball game, to electrical fluctuations in the brain.\n",

    "In this course, we discuss two types of timeseries from the human brain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Voltage on the brain surface, recorded from electrodes.\n",
    "2. A measure of blood flow in the cortex of the brain, recorded with an fMRI machine.\n",
