    "## Lab 4: Writing functions, Data normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we talked about writing re-usable functions. Specifically, we wrote a plot function that was eventually incorporated into the visualization sub-module of `neurods` (`neurods.viz`). We also talked about data normalization, and introduced pycortex, our library for visualizing brain data on the cortical surface. For the first homework question, we will write a function to load data from NIfTI (.nii.gz) files; for the second homework question, we will use pycortex to show some data. First, a quick review of how to load data and plot data in pycortex:"
