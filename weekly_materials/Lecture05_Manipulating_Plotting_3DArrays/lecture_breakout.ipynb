    "\n",
    "While visualizing a volume as multiple images is useful if you want to see every single voxel, many neuroscientists are interested only in the cortex. When that is the case, there are several reasons why using cortical surface maps, or flatmaps, are a better alternative to multiple images:\n",
    "* Cortical surface maps provide a way to examine all cortical fMRI data at once, with the anatomical location of the functional data made clear. \n",
    "* Since flatmaps are segmented as a prerequisite, you know that all the activity you are viewing is grey-matter, not white matter or CSF. Because the BOLD signal is actually measuring the properties of blood, it is possible to get what looks like significant activity that is actually an artifact of a blood vessel in the white matter, which is misleading.\n",
    "* Voxels that are close together in 3D space may not be close on the cortical surface due to the folding gyri and sulci of the cortex. Since functionality is generally localized proximally on the cortical surface, we often see ROIs of a functional region look like a ball in 3D space (or even worse), but make a lot of sense on a flat map.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will again use **`pycortex`** to visualize 3-D volume arrays on cortical surface maps. To map the functional data onto the cortex, pycortex requires the same two pieces of information required when retrieving the cortical mask, namely the **subject** and **transformation** names."
