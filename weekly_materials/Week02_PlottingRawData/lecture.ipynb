    "Recording from brains generates a particular kind of data. Usually this entails recording some signal at many points in time. This is called a *timeseries*. In neuroscience there are many packages specializing in questions that are of interest to us. One of the first packages that we'll use is called MNE-Python (we'll just call it MNE).\n",

    "MNE was first created to do one specific thing: compute something called a \"Minimum Norm Estimate\". This is a technique for determining a source of activity in the brain. However, over time people used for more and more things. Now it is a general framework for analysing electrical signals from the brain.\n",

    "A timeseries can be anything from stock market fluctuations, to the changes in score during a basketball game, to electrical fluctuations in the brain.\n",
