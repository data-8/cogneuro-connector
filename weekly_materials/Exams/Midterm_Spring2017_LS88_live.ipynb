    "# Part 1 - Planning an experiment\n",
    "In this part, we will design a cognitive neuroscience experiment. First, think of a controlled experiment that you would like to do consisting of two conditions. For example, if you are interested in color representation, you could show images that are colored in one condition, and images that are black and white in the other. To find which parts of the brain represent color, you can compare event-related fMRI responses and see which regions have higher responses when looking at colored images versus black and white images. To find out *when* the response to color images is different from black and white images, you could compare response time courses measured by EEG. (You have to chose another example besides color).\n",
