    "# Contrasting experimental conditions\n",
    "In this week's lecture we covered one method for contrasting brain activity in response to different kinds of trials. For this lab, we'll look at the ERP in response to another kind of event: auditory and visual. Each of these should have their own signature pattern of activity, as well as distributions across the brain. We'll then transition over to ECoG, where we can investigate how the patterns of specificity differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll also use resampling (bootstrap) statistics in order to both illustrate the variability present in our signals, as well as to make inferential statements about \"how much\" the brain activity differs between conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Data\n",
    "We'll use the same data from lecture in order to look at the activity in EEG. Our ECoG data will be the consonant / dissonant chords task we covered last week. This time, we'll start to incorporate more information about the trials into our analysis."
