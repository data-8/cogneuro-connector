    "\n",
    "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or fMRI, is a measure of brain activity over time. FMRI data is acquired using a special pulse sequence designed to measure changes in the magnetic properties of the blood flow using the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/mri_scanner.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional signal we measure with fMRI is *not* an electrical neural signal (as in EEG, ECoG, or electrophysiology). It is a magnetic signal related to the properties of brain tissue, and it is dominated by blood flow. Blood flow is related to neural activity, because firing neurons need oxygen. The process of firing involves letting electrically charged ions into a cell and actively pumping them back out again, which is metabolically demanding. So once a region of the brain becomes active (once the neurons start firing), metabolism in that region is high, oxygen gets stripped off of hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells in the area (thereby changing the magnetic properties of hemoglobin, creating a deoxyhemoglobin). This initiates a complex process to increase blood flow to the electrically active area. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/deoxyhemoglobin.png\" style=\"height: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific mechanisms that lead from neural activity to changes in blood flow are (a) not well understood, and (b) beyond the scope of this class. For now, just know that there are several ways to measure functional responses with MRI, and the specific one that we work with is the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent Response, or the BOLD response. \n",
    "\n",
    "### fMRI has high spatial but low temporal resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "We have belabored this here a little because this complexity should always be a source of humility for anyone working with fMRI or trying to interpret fMRI results. It is an **indirect, slow measure** - and these considerations strongly constrain the kinds of experiments you can do with fMRI and the conclusions you can draw from those experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important practical upshot of this for our purposes is that the signal we measure changes much more slowly than the signal we measure in EEG or ECoG. Responses emerge over seconds, not milliseconds.\n",

    "One fMRI image (fMRI volume) is acquired for a given unit of time called a repetition time (TR). A TR is typically 1-2 seconds *(usually 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 seconds)*. Every image records the activity in the brain at a given point in time. The following image shows a single volume of fMRI data (one two-second snapshot of brain activity).\n",

    "Once a neural event is triggered by a stimulus presentation the vascular system needs to respond to the need for glucose and oxygen in that specific brain area. This can take up to 1-2 seconds. Hence the hemodynamic response lags the triggered event by 1-2 seconds, which peaks around 5 seconds after the stimulus onset.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can measure fMRI responses across the whole brain. Therefore fMRI can be seen as a *mapping* technique. In order to make brain maps, we have to be able to match measured voxel responses to the participant's brain anatomy. Using a different type of MRI sequence, we can collect a **structural scan** (also called **anatomical scan**), and obtain a high resolution image of a participant's brain. Here is an example:\n",

For this reason, we need to make sure the criteria we use to move each 3D image to a matrix row is preserved and this operation is inverted. Let's look at an example.\n",
