    "Imagine you have a small dataset with voxel responses to features, and some of the voxels have some noise that is correlated to one of the features. The probability of such an event becomes smaller as the dataset size increases, but at low sample sizes there is a good chance of finding spurious correlations. Such a correlation actually allows you to build a model that predicts brain activity from the features, but only in that dataset, since the noise is independent of the data and will not repeat in the same way in other datasets. However, for the voxels that show a real and strong enough response to the features, you will be able to learn a model that predicts brain activity from the features, and that model should generalize to new data.\n",
