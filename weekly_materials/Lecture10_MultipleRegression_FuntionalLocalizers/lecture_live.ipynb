    "Up to this point we've used two different techniques to analyze our visual localizer data and identify cortical regions that respond to different types of visual stimuli (ROIs), such as faces. First we took the mean of all the TRs during the blocks of each type of stimulus presentation. Then we improved this analysis by accounting for the HRF and correlating response vectors with the BOLD signal. Now we'll use multiple regression to account for the overlapping HRFs from adjacent blocks of differing stimulus types. This is the way functional localizers are generally analyzed in contemporary fMRI studies."

Let's get more formal about what we mean by **selective** when talking about ROIs. **Selective** means that a given region responds more to faces than to other types of stimuli. We've learned that there are so called *early visual regions* which process simple (**low-level**) properties of images, such as edges or curves. Since these regions are active whenever there is any kind of visual stimulus we wouldn't want to say they are face selective just because they are active when the subject views images of faces, those regions would be active for any type of image. By comparing BOLD signal increase to images of faces relative to rest we foundactivity in early visual regions as well as the face selective regions. \n",

So in this case we simply want the cognitive process of face processing, but not general low-level visual processing. So how do we go about finding a brain region that is involved in face processing, but not any other cognitive processes? We do this by being smart about the functional contrasts we use. \n",
