    "Now that we've taken a look at raw data, it's time to start doing things with this data. Today we'll focus on finding events of interest in the brain activity. Specifically, we're going to focus on one of the most important tasks in any neuroscience analysis: **cleaning messy data**. There are many, many sources of noise in neuroscience, and the first step in any analysis should be to check it out and determine what's going on. \n",
